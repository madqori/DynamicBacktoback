# DynamicBacktoback
Very simple project to help you create dynamic backtoback or arrange something with no adjacent.

To run this file u need jdk installed at your Computer, cz its java based :D

1. Clone this project or downloaded "DynamicBacktoback.class" make you already have jdk haha
2. Go to the directory there is DynamicBacktoback.class exist, then run "java DynamicBacktoback"
3. put argument separated by commas(,)
   example : a,a,a,b,b,d,e,f
4. you will find dynamic result everytime you try to generate new one, it will show different result
